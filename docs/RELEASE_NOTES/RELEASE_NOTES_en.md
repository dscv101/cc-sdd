---

## üöÄ Ver 2.0.0-alpha.3 (2025-10-22)

### üéØ Highlights
- **Windsurf IDE support**: Added a dedicated manifest, workflow templates under `.windsurf/workflows/`, and an AGENTS.md quickstart so Windsurf users can run the full kiro Spec-Driven Development workflow with `npx cc-sdd@next --windsurf`.
- **CLI experience refresh**: Updated completion guides and recommended models so the setup summary now points Windsurf users to the correct follow-up commands and manual QA flow.

### üß™ Quality & Tooling
- Added `realManifestWindsurf` integration tests that cover dry-run planning, cross-platform (macOS/Linux) execution, and completion messaging.
- Extended CLI argument parsing to recognize the `--windsurf` alias and ensured the agent registry emits the correct layout metadata.

### üìö Documentation
- Refreshed the root README, CLI docs (`tools/cc-sdd/README*`), and legacy guides (`docs/README/README_{en,ja,zh-TW}.md`) with Windsurf instructions, updated quick-start matrices, and the manual QA checklist using `npx cc-sdd@next --windsurf`.

### üìà Key Metrics
- **Supported platforms**: 7 (Claude Code, Cursor IDE, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, Qwen Code, Windsurf IDE)
- **Command/workflow count**: 11 per agent (identical spec/validate/steering coverage)
- **Automated coverage**: 1 new real-manifest test scenario dedicated to Windsurf

---

## üöÄ Ver 2.0.0 (2025-10-13)

### üéØ Highlights
- **Guided CLI installer**: The `npx cc-sdd@latest` flow now previews planned files, groups them by Commands / Project Memory / Settings, and lets you choose overwrite vs append for agent docs so reinstalling is safer and faster.
- **Spec-driven command redesign**: Re-authored all 11 commands per agent (`spec-*`, `validate-*`, `steering*`) and removed `.tpl` files, making specs, designs, and task plans easier to tailor per project.
- **Steering overhaul**: The steering command no longer summarizes just `product/tech/structure`; every document under `steering/` now carries equal weight and captures reusable rules, patterns, examples, and guidelines so governance can evolve with the project.
- **Flexible deliverables**: The new `templates/shared/settings/` bundle deploys into `{{KIRO_DIR}}/settings`, so teams can tailor requirements/design/tasks formats without rewriting the core templates.
- **Codex CLI support**: Ships 11 prompts to `.codex/prompts/`, enabling the full Spec-Driven Development workflow for Codex CLI users.
- **GitHub Copilot support**: Automatically installs the same 11 prompts under `.github/prompts/`, leveraging the shared steering/templates bundle to keep workflow parity.

### üõ†Ô∏è Under-the-Hood Improvements
- **Unified template layout**: Removed per-OS directories and consolidated into a single `commands/` tree; all templates now ship as `.md` / `.prompt.md` / `.toml` assets with runtime substitutions.
- **Manifest & CLI updates**: Rewrote manifests to the new layout, added Codex/GitHub Copilot manifests, exposed `--codex` / `--github-copilot` flags, and extended `resolveAgentLayout` with the new output paths.
- **Testing & QA**: Refreshed real-manifest integration tests to cover `.kiro/settings` output and added new end-to-end coverage for Codex CLI and GitHub Copilot.
- **Documentation**: Updated all READMEs (English/Japanese/Traditional Chinese) plus the repo root README with the expanded agent list, 11-command structure, and unified directory layout.

### üìà Key Metrics
- **Supported platforms**: 6 (Claude Code, Cursor IDE, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, Qwen Code)
- **Command count**: 11 (6 spec + 3 validate + 2 steering)
- **Artifacts shipped**: Agent commands, project memory, shared settings bundle
