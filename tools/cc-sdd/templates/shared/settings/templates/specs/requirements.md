## Intent and Context

### Why This Feature Exists
{{BUSINESS_PROBLEM}} - Clearly articulate the core problem this solves, not just what it does.

**Example:** "Users currently spend 15-20 minutes manually reconciling payment records across three different systems, leading to errors and delayed month-end close. This feature eliminates manual reconciliation by providing real-time sync and conflict detection."

### Success Criteria
How will we measure if this succeeds?
- {{SUCCESS_METRIC_1}} (e.g., "Reduce reconciliation time from 15min to <2min")
- {{SUCCESS_METRIC_2}} (e.g., "Achieve 99.9% data consistency between systems")

### What We're NOT Solving (Explicit Non-Goals)
- {{NON_GOAL_1}} - Be explicit about scope boundaries
- {{NON_GOAL_2}} - Future considerations outside current scope

### Key Assumptions and Constraints
- {{ASSUMPTION_1}} (e.g., "Payment provider API response time <500ms")
- {{CONSTRAINT_1}} (e.g., "Must work with existing authentication system")

### Alternatives Considered
| Alternative | Why Not Chosen |
|-------------|----------------|
| {{ALT_1}} | {{RATIONALE_1}} |
| {{ALT_2}} | {{RATIONALE_2}} |

## Requirements

> **EARS Notation Guidelines:**
> - Use concrete system/service names, not generic placeholders (e.g., "Payment Service" not "the system")
> - Each requirement must be testable and unambiguous
> - Use SHALL for mandatory, SHOULD for recommended, MAY for optional
> - Always document the intent behind each requirement

### Requirement 1.0: {{REQUIREMENT_AREA_1}}

**ID:** REQ-1.0  
**Priority:** {{PRIORITY}} (Critical | High | Medium | Low)  
**Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_REQUIREMENT}} - Explain the underlying need, not just what it does

**User Story:** As a {{SPECIFIC_ROLE}} (e.g., "Finance Manager"), I need {{SPECIFIC_CAPABILITY}} (e.g., "automated payment reconciliation"), so that {{MEASURABLE_BENEFIT}} (e.g., "I can close month-end 2 days faster").

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

**Event-Driven Requirements (WHEN-THEN):**
1. WHEN [specific user action or system event] THEN [concrete system name] SHALL [specific, measurable response]
   - **Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_BEHAVIOR}}
   - **Example:** WHEN user submits payment form THEN Payment Service SHALL validate all fields within 200ms and return field-specific error messages for any invalid inputs

2. WHEN [event] AND [specific condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
   - **Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_BEHAVIOR}}
   - **Example:** WHEN payment fails AND retry count < 3 THEN Payment Service SHALL automatically retry after exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)

**State-Based Requirements (IF-THEN):**
3. IF [specific state or precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
   - **Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_BEHAVIOR}}
   - **Example:** IF user balance is insufficient THEN Payment Service SHALL reject transaction and suggest minimum top-up amount

**Continuous Behavior (WHILE-THE):**
4. WHILE [ongoing condition] THE [system] SHALL [continuous behavior]
   - **Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_BEHAVIOR}}
   - **Example:** WHILE payment is processing THE Payment Service SHALL display real-time status updates every 500ms

**Contextual Requirements (WHERE-THE):**
5. WHERE [location/context] THE [system] SHALL [contextual behavior]
   - **Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_BEHAVIOR}}
   - **Example:** WHERE user is on checkout page THE Payment Service SHALL encrypt all form data using TLS 1.3 before transmission

**Negative Requirements (SHALL NOT):**
6. [System] SHALL NOT [prohibited behavior] [under specific conditions]
   - **Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_CONSTRAINT}}
   - **Example:** Payment Service SHALL NOT store unencrypted credit card numbers in any logs or databases

#### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Each criterion is testable with clear pass/fail conditions
- [ ] Subject is specific (actual system name, not "the system")
- [ ] Avoids ambiguous terms (fast, user-friendly, intuitive)
- [ ] Intent is documented for non-obvious requirements
- [ ] Performance requirements include specific numbers
- [ ] Error cases are explicitly covered

### Requirement 1.1: {{SUB_REQUIREMENT_AREA}}

**ID:** REQ-1.1  
**Parent:** REQ-1.0  
**Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_REQUIREMENT}}

**User Story:** As a {{ROLE}}, I need {{CAPABILITY}}, so that {{BENEFIT}}

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
   - **Intent:** {{WHY}}

<!-- Continue numbering: REQ-2.0, REQ-2.1, etc. -->

### Requirement 2.0: {{REQUIREMENT_AREA_2}}

**ID:** REQ-2.0  
**Priority:** {{PRIORITY}}  
**Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_REQUIREMENT}}

**User Story:** As a {{ROLE}}, I need {{CAPABILITY}}, so that {{BENEFIT}}

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
   - **Intent:** {{WHY}}

## Conflict and Ambiguity Check

### Potential Conflicts
Review these common conflict patterns:
- [ ] Requirements with contradictory performance targets
- [ ] Requirements that assume mutually exclusive states
- [ ] Requirements with overlapping responsibilities between systems

**Identified Conflicts:**
| Conflict | Requirements | Resolution |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| {{CONFLICT_DESCRIPTION}} | REQ-X, REQ-Y | {{HOW_RESOLVED}} |

### Ambiguities and Open Questions
| Question | Impact | Owner | Target Resolution Date |
|----------|--------|-------|----------------------|
| {{QUESTION_1}} | {{IMPACT}} | {{OWNER}} | {{DATE}} |

### Cross-Requirement Dependencies
| Requirement | Depends On | Nature of Dependency |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| REQ-1.1 | REQ-1.0 | Must implement REQ-1.0 first |

## Review and Approval

### Review Checklist
