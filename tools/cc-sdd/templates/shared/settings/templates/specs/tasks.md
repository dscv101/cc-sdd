# Implementation Task Plan

> **"Tasks are the executable projection of design into work. Each task should preserve the intent from requirements through to code."**
>
> This document breaks design into implementable, testable units of work with clear success criteria.

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation ({{PHASE_1_ESTIMATE}})

- [ ] **1.0 Set up project foundation and infrastructure**
  **Intent:** Establish the baseline environment and tools required for all subsequent development. Without this, no feature work can begin with consistent quality standards.
  **Owner:** {{OWNER}} | **Effort:** {{ESTIMATE}} | **Risk:** Low
  **Status:** Not Started
  
  **Implementation Details:**
  - Initialize project repository with selected technology stack (refer to design.md Section: Technology Stack)
  - Configure development environment with linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment stages
  - Establish logging and monitoring infrastructure
  - Configure environment management (dev, staging, production)
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Project builds successfully in clean environment
  - [ ] CI pipeline runs tests and deploys to staging automatically
  - [ ] All developers can run project locally following README instructions
  - [ ] Logging captures application events at appropriate levels
  
  **Requirement Traceability:**
  - Enables: All requirements (foundational infrastructure)
  - Implements: [Infrastructure Setup] from design.md Section: Architecture
  
  **Validation & Testing:**
  - Unit tests: N/A (infrastructure setup)
  - Integration tests: CI pipeline smoke test
  - Manual validation: Developer onboarding dry-run
  
  **Dependencies:**
  - Blocked by: None (first task)
  - Blocks: All subsequent tasks
  
  **Notes/Risks:**
  - Risk: Tool compatibility issues across team's different OS environments
  - Mitigation: Use containerized development environment

### Phase 2: Core Features ({{PHASE_2_ESTIMATE}})

- [ ] **2.0 Build authentication and user management system**
  **Intent:** Users need secure access control before any feature can be safely used. This implements the auth boundary defined in design.md.
  **Owner:** {{OWNER}} | **Effort:** {{ESTIMATE}} | **Risk:** Medium
  **Status:** Not Started
  
  **Sub-tasks:**

- [ ] **2.1 Implement core authentication flow**
  **Intent:** Establish secure identity verification as the foundation of user access. This prevents unauthorized access and enables user-specific features.
  **Owner:** {{OWNER}} | **Effort:** {{ESTIMATE}} | **Risk:** High (security-critical)
  **Status:** Not Started
  
  **Implementation Details:**
  - Set up user data model with password hashing (bcrypt, work factor 12)
  - Implement JWT-based session management with refresh tokens
  - Build registration endpoint with email validation
  - Create login endpoint with rate limiting (5 attempts per 15min window)
  - Add password reset flow with time-limited tokens (1-hour expiry)
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] WHEN user registers with valid email/password THEN Auth Service SHALL create account and send verification email (REQ-7.1)
  - [ ] WHEN user logs in with correct credentials THEN Auth Service SHALL issue JWT token valid for 24 hours (REQ-7.2)
  - [ ] WHEN user provides invalid credentials THEN Auth Service SHALL reject with generic error message (no user enumeration) (REQ-7.3)
  - [ ] IF login attempts exceed 5 in 15 minutes THEN Auth Service SHALL temporarily block IP address (REQ-7.4)
  
  **Requirement Traceability:**
  - Satisfies: REQ-7.1 (User Registration), REQ-7.2 (User Login), REQ-7.3 (Auth Errors), REQ-7.4 (Rate Limiting)
  - Implements: [AuthService] from design.md Section: Components - Authentication Domain
  - Validates: EARS criteria 1.1-1.4 from requirements.md
  
  **Validation & Testing:**
  - Unit tests: Password hashing, JWT generation/validation, rate limiter logic
  - Integration tests: Full registration/login flows, token refresh, password reset
  - Security tests: SQL injection attempts, XSS in email field, timing attacks
  - Manual validation: Test with real email provider, verify emails arrive
  
  **Dependencies:**
  - Blocked by: Task 1.0 (Infrastructure setup)
  - Blocks: Task 3.0 (Feature work requiring auth)
  
  **Notes/Risks:**
  - Risk: JWT secret rotation strategy not yet defined
  - Action: Document secret rotation process in operations runbook
  - Performance: Rate limiter uses Redis - requires Redis availability

- [ ] **2.2 Integrate email service provider**
  **Intent:** Enable automated communication with users (verification, password reset). Required for secure account lifecycle management.
  **Owner:** {{OWNER}} | **Effort:** {{ESTIMATE}} | **Risk:** Low
  **Status:** Not Started
  
  **Implementation Details:**
  - Configure SMTP settings or email API (SendGrid/Mailgun) with secure credential storage
  - Build email template system for verification, welcome, and password reset emails
  - Implement async job queue for email delivery with retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
  - Add email sending observability (delivery rate, bounce rate, failure tracking)
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] WHEN user registers THEN Email Service SHALL send verification email within 30 seconds (REQ-5.1)
  - [ ] IF email delivery fails THEN Email Service SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (REQ-5.2)
  - [ ] WHERE email bounce occurs THE Email Service SHALL mark email invalid and alert user (REQ-5.4)
  
  **Requirement Traceability:**
  - Satisfies: REQ-5.1 (Email Delivery), REQ-5.2 (Email Retry), REQ-5.4 (Bounce Handling)
  - Implements: [EmailService] from design.md Section: Components - Notification Domain
  
  **Validation & Testing:**
  - Unit tests: Template rendering, retry logic, bounce detection
  - Integration tests: Send emails via test provider, verify delivery
  - Manual validation: Test with invalid email addresses, verify error handling
  
  **Dependencies:**
  - Blocked by: Task 1.0 (Infrastructure)
  - Blocks: None (parallel to auth)
  
  **Notes/Risks:**
  - Assumption: Email provider rate limits >1000 emails/hour
  - Validation needed: Confirm rate limits with email provider before production

- [ ] **3.0 {{NEXT_MAJOR_TASK}}**
  **Intent:** {{WHY_THIS_TASK}}
  **Owner:** {{OWNER}} | **Effort:** {{ESTIMATE}} | **Risk:** {{RISK_LEVEL}}
  **Status:** Not Started
