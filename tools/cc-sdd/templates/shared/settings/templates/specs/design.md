# Design Specification

> **"Specifications are executable documentation. Design is where intent becomes architecture."** - Inspired by Sean Grove's work on spec-driven development
>
> This document translates requirements into architecture. It preserves the **why** behind every decision, not just the **what**.

---
**Document Length Guidelines: Max 1000 lines**

**Purpose**: Provide sufficient detail to ensure implementation consistency across different implementers, preventing interpretation drift.

**Approach**:
- Include essential sections that directly inform implementation decisions
- Omit optional sections unless critical to preventing implementation errors
- Match detail level to feature complexity
- Use diagrams and tables over lengthy prose

**Warning**: Approaching 1000 lines indicates excessive feature complexity that may require design simplification.

## Overview 
2-3 paragraphs max
**Purpose**: This feature delivers [specific value] to [target users].
**Users**: [Target user groups] will utilize this for [specific workflows].
**Impact** (if applicable): Changes the current [system state] by [specific modifications].


### Goals
- Primary objective 1
- Primary objective 2  
- Success criteria

### Non-Goals
- Explicitly excluded functionality
- Future considerations outside current scope
- Integration points deferred

## Architecture

### Existing Architecture Analysis (if applicable)
When modifying existing systems:
- Current architecture patterns and constraints
- Existing domain boundaries to be respected
- Integration points that must be maintained
- Technical debt addressed or worked around

### High-Level Architecture
**RECOMMENDED**: Include Mermaid diagram showing system architecture (required for complex features, optional for simple additions)

**Architecture Integration**:
- Existing patterns preserved: [list key patterns]
- New components rationale: [why each is needed]
- Technology alignment: [how it fits current stack]
- Steering compliance: [principles maintained]

### Technology Stack and Design Decisions

**Generation Instructions** (DO NOT include this section in design.md):
Adapt content based on feature classification from Discovery & Analysis Phase:

**For New Features (greenfield)**:
Generate Technology Stack section with ONLY relevant layers:
- Include only applicable technology layers (e.g., skip Frontend for CLI tools, skip Infrastructure for libraries)
- For each technology choice, provide: selection, rationale, and alternatives considered
- Include Architecture Pattern Selection if making architectural decisions

**For Extensions/Additions to Existing Systems**:
Generate Technology Alignment section instead:
- Document how feature aligns with existing technology stack
- Note any new dependencies or libraries being introduced
- Justify deviations from established patterns if necessary

**Key Design Decisions**:
Generate 1-3 critical technical decisions that significantly impact the implementation.
Each decision should follow this format:
- **Decision**: [Specific technical choice made]
- **Context**: [Problem or requirement driving this decision]
- **Alternatives**: [2-3 other approaches considered]
- **Selected Approach**: [What was chosen and how it works]
- **Rationale**: [Why this is optimal for the specific context]
- **Trade-offs**: [What we gain vs. what we sacrifice]

Skip this entire section for simple CRUD operations or when following established patterns without deviation.

## Intent Preservation and Design Rationale

> **Critical**: This section captures the **why** behind the design - the original intent that must not be lost in implementation.

### Why This Design (Non-Obvious Reasoning)
Document the reasoning that won't be obvious from the code:
- {{REASONING_1}}: Why we chose this pattern over more obvious alternatives
- {{REASONING_2}}: What problem this design prevents (that isn't immediately apparent)
- {{REASONING_3}}: How this enables future features or scales

**Example:** "We're using an event-sourced approach not just for audit trails, but because Requirements 2.3-2.5 imply users will need to 'time-travel' through data states. A traditional CRUD model would make this prohibitively expensive to add later."

### What Could Go Wrong (Anticipated Issues)
Be honest about risks and unknowns:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| {{RISK_1}} | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | {{MITIGATION_STRATEGY}} |

**Example:** "High-Likelihood, Medium-Impact: If payment provider webhook latency exceeds 5s (vs assumed 2s), users will see stale data. Mitigation: Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback capability."

### Evolution Path (Future-Proofing)
How does this design enable future requirements?
- {{FUTURE_1}}: This design makes it straightforward to add...
- {{FUTURE_2}}: The architecture accommodates...

**Example:** "By separating notification routing from notification delivery, we can later add per-user notification preferences without touching the core notification logic."

### Explicit Anti-Goals (What We're NOT Solving)
Be crystal clear about scope boundaries:
- {{ANTI_GOAL_1}}: Explicitly not supported in this design
- {{ANTI_GOAL_2}}: Intentionally deferred to future iterations

**Example:** "We are NOT solving multi-region data residency in this design. All data resides in US-East. Adding EU region support later will require design revision."

## Ambiguity Detection and Open Questions

> **Purpose**: Surface assumptions, unknowns, and decisions that need validation before/during implementation.

### Questions Requiring Answers Before Implementation
| Question | Impact if Wrong | Owner | Target Date | Status |
|----------|----------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| {{QUESTION_1}} | {{IMPACT}} | {{OWNER}} | {{DATE}} | Open/Resolved |

**Example:** "What's the max concurrent webhook volume we need to handle? (Impact: If >1000/sec, need to add queue; if <100/sec, direct processing is fine. Owner: Product. Due: Before sprint start.)"

### Assumptions Requiring Validation
| Assumption | Validation Method | Risk if Invalid |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| {{ASSUMPTION_1}} | {{HOW_TO_VERIFY}} | {{RISK}} |

**Example:** "Assumption: External API response time <500ms. Validation: Load test in staging. Risk: If >2s, need to add caching layer."

### Integration Points Requiring Negotiation
External systems or teams we depend on:
| Integration Point | Contact | Open Items | Blocker Status |
|------------------|---------|------------|----------------|
| {{SYSTEM_1}} | {{CONTACT}} | {{ITEMS}} | Yes/No |

**Example:** "Analytics Service: @data-team. Open: Event schema approval. Blocker: Yes - can't implement without schema."

### Design Decisions Pending Clarification
Decisions made but confidence is low:
| Decision | Confidence | What Would Change It |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| {{DECISION_1}} | Low/Medium | {{TRIGGER_FOR_CHANGE}} |

**Example:** "Decision: Use Redis for session storage. Confidence: Medium. Would change if: Sessions need to survive Redis failures (then use DB-backed sessions)."

## System Flows

**Flow Design Generation Instructions** (DO NOT include this section in design.md):
Generate appropriate flow diagrams ONLY when the feature requires flow visualization. Select from:
- **Sequence Diagrams**: For user interactions across multiple components
- **Process Flow Charts**: For complex algorithms, decision branches, or state machines  
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: For data transformations, ETL processes, or data pipelines
- **State Diagrams**: For complex state transitions
- **Event Flow**: For async/event-driven architectures

Skip this section entirely for simple CRUD operations or features without complex flows.
When included, provide concise Mermaid diagrams specific to the actual feature requirements.

## Requirements Traceability

**Traceability Generation Instructions** (DO NOT include this section in design.md):
Generate traceability mapping ONLY for complex features with multiple requirements or when explicitly needed for compliance/validation.

When included, create a mapping table showing how each EARS requirement is realized:
| Requirement | Requirement Summary | Components | Interfaces | Flows |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1.1 | Brief description | Component names | API/Methods | Relevant flow diagrams |

Alternative format for simpler cases:
- **1.1**: Realized by [Component X] through [Interface Y]
- **1.2**: Implemented in [Component Z] with [Flow diagram reference]

Skip this section for simple features with straightforward 1:1 requirement-to-component mappings.

## Components and Interfaces

**Component Design Generation Instructions** (DO NOT include this section in design.md):
Structure components by domain boundaries or architectural layers. Generate only relevant subsections based on component type.
Group related components under domain/layer headings for clarity.
